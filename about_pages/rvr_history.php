    Society.The founder-members of Nagarjuna Education Society and their successors have provided abundant inputs to
    turn a mere 3 programmes -180-intake College into a 16 programmes -1428 - intake by the 2020. The premier status of
    the institution is made possible by sticking to our core-principles of student-focus, Human Resource Development and
