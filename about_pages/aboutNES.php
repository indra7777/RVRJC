<p>The Nagarjuna Education Society (Regd.), Guntur, was established and registered in 1967 by Philanthropists, Medical
    Doctors, Industrial and Commercial houses and the elite of Guntur with a mission of serving the Society through
    promotion of Education, Literature and Culture.

    The Nagarjuna Education Society(NES) had taken its birth with the social objective of providing educational
    opportunities to the rural youth who had been migrating to the towns in pursuit of education. The concept gained
    momentum and the Nagarjuna Education Society was established and **Registered on 27th December, 1967 (No. 56 of
    1967) under Societies Act XXI of 1860** with the following objectives, incorporated in the memorandum of articles.</p>

<p>The strength of the Society is that it is not a religious or charitable or social or a family trust. No individual
    had a controlling interest and the society did not bequeath large endowments that confer managing right or
    controlling interest on any group or individual. It is purely an educational society to which numerous people,
    organizations and individuals have donated, only to contribute to the cause of education than for a personal gain or
    aggrandizement.</p>

    <p>The enthusiasm, spirit of service and the pursuit of objectives have been sustained for the last forty years by a
    succession of members. Power struggles to get hold of the society, crises of management, interference in the
    administration and dominance of individuals in the society's affairs were totally absent in its history. General
    Body Meetings, elections to the Executive Body are regularly conducted in a cordial manner and the elected members
    are vested with their defined responsibilities as per the memorandum of articles. Most of the Executive Members are
    unanimously elected. Everyone had the same mission, promoting education, not himself.</p>

    <p>Quality of instruction through student-centered teaching, updating the teacher-capability and qualifications,
    exploiting the student talent, developing personality and citizenship in students are the guiding principles in
    running the institutions. Seminars, Workshops for teachers/students are regularly held to diffuse knowledge beyond
    the curriculum.</p>

    <p>Financial assistance to the poor and needy students was liberally provided through scholarship endowments.</p>
