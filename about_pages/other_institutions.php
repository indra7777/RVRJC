<p>The Nagarjuna Education Society during its 50 years of existence established the following institutions, all known
    for quality education in their category. The notable feature is that none of the institutions had ever been closed
    temporarily or listed under 'reduced intake'. There was never an instance when any of the institution had to
    challenge the action of the statutory bodies or seek redressal of grievances in a court of law.</p>
